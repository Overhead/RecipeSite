##Edit and Delete Recipe
Even though we thought that creating, editing and deleting a recipe would be easy
it turned out the be the oposite. When working with many_to_many tables in between the models
it was a little more complicated to get it working right. We ended up with a solution but it may
have to be improved in the future. 

##CSS
Across the site there is many non-finished div blocks etc. so one part of the finishing touch
was to add CSS to different objects. 

##Presentation
Today we also created the presentation that shall be shown 10.12.2013

##Deployment
At the end we deployed our working solution to the web-server in AWS
