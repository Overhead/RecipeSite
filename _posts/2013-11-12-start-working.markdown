Today we started working on the app for real. We have already chosen to use Ruby on Rails to develope our site.

## Framework
We wanted to use a modern language to build the app, the choises we talked about were ruby, python and node. We chose ruby on rails becours we have heard good things about it, and becours Jon Martin is using python (and django) in another course while Emil have spent more time looking at node.js. So, to try out something new, ruby.

## Start
After getting everything set up, we found it very easy to get work with rails so far. There are alot of built in functionality to handle everything from db migrations to routing.

We did some db modeling around the recipes and got it set up while trying out rails.
