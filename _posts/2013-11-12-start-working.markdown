Today we started working on the app for real. For developing the site it has been 
decided to use Ruby on Rails

## Framework
We wanted to use a modern language to build our app, and the choices we talked about 
were ruby, python and node. We ended up with Ruby on Rails because we both wanted to try 
something new and we have heard other developers talk about the wonders of RoR. 
Also one of the reasonse that we didn't go for any of the others were beause 
Jon Martin is using python (and django) in another course while
Emil have spent more time looking at node.js. So, to try out something new we decided on ruby.

## Start
After getting everything set up, we found out that it was very easy to get 
work done with rails. There are a lot of built-in functionality to handle 
everything from db migrations to routing.

We did some db modeling around the recipes and got it set up while trying out rails.
