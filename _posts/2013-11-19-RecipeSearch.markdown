Today Jon Martin started looking further on how search shall work

## Search 
When the user enter this web-site he/she shall be presented by a easy to use search engine.
The user shall be able to search for recipe name, and/or ingredients and then get a result that 
satisifies the search. There shall also be a possibility to do advanced searches and the 
user shall have easy access to modify these options. Todays work will start this work.
