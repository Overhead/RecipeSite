##Deployment
Today Emil has looked on how we shall deploy our website to the web, and he was
able to do this by using Amazon Web Services and an Ubuntu 13 server. Here he installed
Ruby on Rails and an Apache plugin called Passanger to depoy it. Information on where
the server is will come on a later date.

##Login
Today Jon Martin worked on getting a standard user login requirement prompt if
an url is accessed that requires login, and started work on translating recipe
ingredient lines from US units to Scandinavian.
